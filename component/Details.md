## Details

CRSAlertView is a Xamarin component built for iOS that replaces the stock UIAlertView with something a little more customizable and beautiful. Off the bat, CRSAlertView provides support for an icon image and text input so your alert can be more like a modular information view that takes screen precedence. 

CRSAlertView was built by the mobile team at [Curse, Inc.](https://curseinc.com) and is used extensively in the [Curse Voice for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/curse/id935720218) app.
